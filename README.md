# Hand_Track_Mouse
 AI-Powered Hand Gesture-Based Mouse Controller This project implements a hand-gesture-based mouse control system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. It leverages computer vision and machine learning to detect hand landmarks in real-time and perform various mouse operations such as:  Move the cursor: Tracks the index finger tip's position to control the mouse cursor. Left click: Performs a left-click gesture. Right click: Detects a right-click gesture. Double click: Recognizes a double-click gesture. Features: Uses MediaPipe to process hand landmarks. Gesture recognition based on angles and distances between hand landmarks. Smooth mouse movement with adjustable sensitivity. Real-time video feed for feedback and visualization. Tech Stack: Python OpenCV for video frame processing. MediaPipe for hand tracking and landmark detection. PyAutoGUI and Pynput for mouse control actions. How to Use: Connect a webcam. Run the script to start the real-time hand gesture detection. Perform gestures to control the mouse. Press 'Q' to exit. This project is an exciting example of human-computer interaction using AI!
